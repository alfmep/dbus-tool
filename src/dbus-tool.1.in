.B -b, --bus=ADDRESS
Connect to a specific bus address. Ignoring parameter -y, --system.

If argument 'property' is omitted, the names and values of all properties are printed to standard output.

.B OPTIONS
.nf
.TP

<service> is the DBus service we want to receive signals from.

the specified interface.
If we specify a signal name, we will only listen for that signal.
If not, we will listen for all signals using that interface.
When a signal is received, is is printed to standard output.
Stop listening and exit the program by pressing Ctrl-C.

.B OPTIONS
.nf
.TP
.B -q, --quiet
Suppress output, exit with 0 on success and 1 on falure.
.RE


.B owner <service>
.RS 4
Print the unique bus name of the primary owner of the name.
.RE

.B names <bus-name>
.RS 4
Print the names acquired by the bus connection.
.RE

.B ping <service>
.RS 4
Ping a service on the bus and print the response time in milliseconds.

.B OPTIONS
.nf

Arguments to the signals begins with a DBus signature, then the argument value.

omitted if the argument is a boolean(true|false), string, or
a signed integer.
